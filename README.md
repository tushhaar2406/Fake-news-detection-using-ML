# Fake News Detection  

## Overview  
This project focuses on detecting fake news using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The implementation is done using Python, with Jupyter Notebook as the development environment.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of labeled news articles, where each article is categorized as either **fake** or **real**. The dataset includes features such as news text, headlines, and metadata.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)  
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)  
- NLTK, Spacy (Text Processing)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)  

## Project Workflow  
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Load dataset  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Text cleaning and tokenization  
   - Stopword removal and lemmatization  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - TF-IDF vectorization  
   - Word embeddings (if applicable)  

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Train machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, etc.)  
   - Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

4. **Predictions & Analysis**  
   - Test the model on unseen data  
   - Interpret model results and performance metrics  


## Future Enhancements  
- Integrate deep learning models like LSTMs or Transformers for improved accuracy.  
- Deploy as a web application using Flask or FastAPI.
